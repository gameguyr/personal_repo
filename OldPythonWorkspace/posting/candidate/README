this directory contains some lists of RA and DEC from
some conversations on gmail with Ron Markze that I THINK
hold the final reduction of candidates that I was looking at
before we went to KPNO.

here are the notes from the email

----------------------------

NOTE_1 :

The files 'prim_or_2a.txt' or 'prim_or_2b.txt'  are from when I selected the 'Resolved' check within criteria 1 based on having a primtarget set.
I realized only after that this is exactly what I didn't want  but I would say it picks off the "low hanging fruit" .
Like I've found a couple potential UCD's within those files where the redshift of the candidate matches the primary it was taken from.  That's a "bingo!"  right?


NOTE_2:

The other two files are where I do not have prim target set but rather  DELTA GT dSpec,
in  other words...just our original criteria.  I'm including a picture of what the original criteria was.

----------------------------

The picture I have also included in this directory.
