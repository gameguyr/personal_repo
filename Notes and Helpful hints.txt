WORKING WITH JUPYTER NOTEBOOKS
I have found that you can run a small jupyter sever by running this

/Users/lego/git/personal_repo/helpingBrianna % jupyter notebook

Note you must be in the directory where the notebooks live.

I also had to add the python kernal to jupyter via

python -m IPython kernel install --name "local-venv" --user
